This is a sample website made as part of
[*Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial),

After finishing *Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*, I'll know enough Git to be
*dangerous*. This means I'll be able to use Git to track changes in my projects,
back up data, share my work with others, and collaborate with programmers and
other users of Git.
